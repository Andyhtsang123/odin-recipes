    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You can make sushi yourself at home! All you need is fish, rice, seaweed, and a bamboo mat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh fish of your choice</li>
        <li>Shortgrain rice</li>
        <li>Seaweed (Nori) sheets</li>
        <li>Sushi vinegar or vinegar powder</li>
        <li>Any sauces you'd like: spicy mayo, wasabi, yuzu kosho, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse your rice 2-3 times. Place in the rice cooker and let that cook until completion.</li>
        <li>Prepare your fish, slice it into the appropriate size for your sushi ie. cube, slices, chopped, etc.</li>
        <li>After your rice is cooked, pour the vinegar and fold it into the rice and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Once your rice is cooled you can use it to make your sushi. You can either make nigiri or hand rolls</li>
        <li>If making nigiri: mold a small block of rice and place a piece of sliced fish on top before molding together.</li>
        <li>If making a handroll: lay a piece of nori down and spread out some rice. Add your fish, slice or chopped, and then begin to roll it into a log. 
            Using the bamboo mat you can further shape it and neaten it. </li>

    </ol>
